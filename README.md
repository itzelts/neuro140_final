# Code Base for Neuro 140 Final Project: Modeling Phase Transitions in Grid Cell Dynamics Across Sensory-Path Integration Conflicts

All code was written by me, Itzel Sanchez (though some was inspired by theoretical models cited in paper)

Code includes model for:

1. 1D Attractor Network for:
  a. Continuous Visual Input
  b. Discrete Visual Input
2. 2D Attractor Network for:
  a. Continuous Visual Input
3. Any accompanying analysis
